# Platut
A 2D platformer tutorial game made with libgdx, box2D and ashley.

## Setup

Go to the libGDX website and make yourself familiar with setting up a libGDX 
environment. You will need intelliJ or AndroidStudio if you want to do this,
otherwise you will have to find a way to use it on your preferred IDE.

Once you download this repo open your IDE and follow these steps:
- Synch gradle.
- Create a new run/debug configuration.
- Set the main class to be "com.platut.desktop.DesktopLauncher"
- Set the working dir to "./Platut/core/assets"
- Set the classpath module to "desktop"

And that's it! You should be able to run this configuration and see the demo.
